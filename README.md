# HOG_Feature_Extractor

**C++ based HOG Feature Extractor Using OpenCV**

This class extracts the feature vector of provided input image based on Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) technique. 

You first need to install OpenCV and provide relevant header files' path correctly. 

To use the class, you first need to read the image, then send it to the class to obtain HOG feature vector. Take a look at `main.cpp` for a detailed example of usage.
